//: ## Q1: Optionals
//: The compiler is yelling at us. Why isn't this the correct way to unwrap optionals?

class Foo {
    
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (words: [String?]) {
        wordA = words[0]
        wordB = words[1]
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q1 HERE]
    //: Optionals do not need to be specified after every variable assignment. The compiler already knows it's an optional because it is specified here "init (words: [String?])."

    
//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
//: Why does the compiler dislike the for loop? Also, what should we return?
    
    class func arePalindromes(words: [String]) -> Bool! {
        let reversedWords = words.map() {String($0.characters.reverse())}
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for var i = 0; i < numElements; i++ {
            if words[i] != reversedWords[i] {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
    
//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q2 HERE]
    //: The 'let' term defines a constant, but 'i' is changing so it should be a variable. Similary in line 3, numElements is a constant, so that should be let instead. The function should also return true at the bottom.
    
    
//: ## Q3: More functions, and object initialization
//: The method should be returning true or false -- what's wrong?
//: Are we initializing the dictionary correctly?
    class func isAnagram(wordA: String, wordB: String) -> Bool {
        var countLetters = [Character : Int]()
        let lenA = wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        var arrA = Array(wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
}

//: [EXPLAIN YOUR ANSWER TO Q3 HERE]
//: The beginning of the function was stated to be an optional, and there was a return nil as the end of the function. Because the function should just return true of false if the two words are anagrams, there isn't really a nil case at all, so the Optional is uneeded and the final return value is changed to True. In order to initialize the empty dictionary, it uses an '=' symbol and needs a () at the end of the statement as well.

//: **Do not** change anything below.
//: You should be able to call the methods as is.
